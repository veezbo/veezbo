# AI, Research, Engineering, Philosophy

Hi! My name is Vibhor Kumar. I'm a computer scientist, amateur neuroscientist, and armchair philosopher of science. I like working at the intersection of the theoretical and applied. My work has been involved in mapping fly brains, catching financial fraud, and generating assets of various types using AI.

I currently work on the Trust & Safety team @[Tinder](https://github.com/Tinder) where I combine skills in ML, Data Science, and Backend to catch bad actors and keep Tinder safe. I also advise AI startups on the side.

Feel free to check out my personal website at [veezbo.com](http://veezbo.com) to learn more!
