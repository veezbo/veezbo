# AI, Research, Engineering, Philosophy

Hi! My name is Vibhor Kumar. I'm a computer scientist, amateur neuroscientist, and armchair philosopher of science. I like working at the intersection of the theoretical and applied. My work has been involved in mapping fly brains, catching financial fraud, and generating assets of various types using AI.

I currently work on the Trust & Safety team @[Tinder](https://github.com/Tinder) where I combine skills in ML, Data Science, and Backend to make an impact. I also advise AI startups.

Feel free to check out my personal website at [veezbo.com](http://veezbo.com) to learn more!

## 📚🧠 I’m currently working on
### Llourney: Stable Diffusion with a fine-tuned LLM instead of CLIP  
[Github Repo Link](https://github.com/veezbo/llourney-dev)  
Collaborators: [@dg845](https://github.com/dg845) [@andrewryanchama](https://github.com/andrewryanchama)  
> Exploring the feasibility of replacing CLIP with an LLM fine-tuned using a frozen Stable Diffusion model and diffusion training loop.

### Akkadian Talker: Understanding Ancient Peoples through Conversation  
_Not yet released_  
> Fine-tuning pre-trained LLMs with a recently-published English-translated ancient language corpus with the ultimate goal of better understanding the “umwelt” of these ancient peoples. Eventually want to partner with museums to make visits more immersive.
